# Linear Regression Non-Linear Transformations

This Jupyter notebook is inspired by the lectures of Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). His YouTube series on machine learning covers a range of concepts, including linear regression and non-linear transformations.

I created this notebook while studying these lectures, and it serves as a study guide to explore these topics further. This is purely for learning purposes, and there may be mistakes. I welcome any corrections or feedback to help improve my understanding.
